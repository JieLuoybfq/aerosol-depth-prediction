# AEROSOL  OPTICAL  DEPTH  PREDICTION  FROM  SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS  BY  MULTIPLE  INSTANCE  REGRESSION

Among the biggest challenges of current climate research is the impact of Aerosols on the Earthâ€™s climate and our health. Recent satellite spectral images and mea-surements enable us to tackle the problem of predicting Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). Several approaches are considered. Our final model uses a probabilistic approach, observations are assumed to be sampled from a distribution and each distribution summarised by a kernel mean embedding.  AOD is predicted for each instance with Kernel Ridge regression and the results combined through a neural network.  This stacking model gave a cross-validation loss of 0.6738 and a public leaderboard loss of 0.6646, the best performance among our peers on the test data provided.
