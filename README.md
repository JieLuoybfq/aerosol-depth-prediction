# Aerosol Optical Depth  prediction by multiple instance regression

Among the biggest challenges of current climate research is the impact of Aerosols on the Earthâ€™s climate and our health. Recent satellite spectral images and measurements enable us to tackle the problem of predicting Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). Several approaches are considered. Our final model uses a probabilistic approach, observations are assumed to be sampled from a distribution and each distribution summarised by a kernel mean embedding.  AOD is predicted for each instance with Kernel Ridge regression and the results combined through a neural network.  This stacking model gave a cross-validation loss of __0.6738__ and a public leaderboard loss of __0.6646__, the best performance among our peers on the test data provided.
